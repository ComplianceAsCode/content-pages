        Run the following command to generate a new database:

<pre>$ sudo /usr/bin/aide --init</pre>

By default, the database will be written to the file

<tt>/var/lib/aide/aide.db.new</tt>.

Storing the database, the configuration file <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>, and the binary
<tt>/usr/bin/aide</tt>
(or hashes of these files), in a secure location (such as on read-only media) provides additional assurance about their integrity.
The newly-generated database can be installed as follows:

<pre>$ sudo cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db</pre>

To initiate a manual check, run the following command:
<pre>$ sudo /usr/bin/aide --check</pre>
If this check produces any unexpected output, investigate.

<pre>OnCalendar=*-*-* 05:00:0</pre> <pre>[Timer]</pre> section in the timer unit and
a Unit section starting the AIDE check service unit should be referred.

        AIDE provides a means to check if unauthorized changes are made to the system.
AIDE itself does not setup a periodic execution, so in order to detect unauthorized
changes a systemd service to run the check and a systemd timer to take care
of periodical execution of that systemd service should be defined.

        The kernel may merge similar slabs together to reduce overhead and increase
cache hotness of objects.
Disabling merging of slabs keeps the slabs separate and reduces the risk of
kernel heap overflows overwriting objects in merged caches.

To disable merging of slabs in the Kernel add the argument <tt>slab_nomerge=yes</tt>
to the default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.
Configure the default Grub2 kernel command line to contain slab_nomerge=yes as follows:
<pre># grub2-editenv - set "$(grub2-editenv - list | grep kernelopts) slab_nomerge=yes"</pre>
      </td>
      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        Disabling the merge of slabs of similar sizes prevents the kernel from
merging a seemingly useless but vulnerable slab with a useful and valuable slab.
This increase the risk that a heap overflow could overwrite objects from merged caches,
with unmerged caches the heap overflow would only affect the objects in the same cache.
Overall, this reduces the kernel attack surface area by isolating slabs from each other.

can disable root logins at the console by editing the <tt>/etc/securetty</tt> file.
This file lists all devices the root user is allowed to login to. If the file does
not exist at all, the root user can login through any communication device on the
system, whether via the console or via a raw network interface. This is dangerous
as user can login to the system as root via Telnet, which sends the password in
plain text over the network. By default, SUSE Linux Enterprise 16's
<tt>/etc/securetty</tt> file only allows the root user to login at the console
physically attached to the system. To prevent root from logging in, remove the
contents of this file. To prevent direct root logins, remove the contents of this
file by typing the following command:
<pre>
$ sudo echo &gt; /etc/securetty
</pre>

        Disabling direct root logins ensures proper accountability and multifactor

Remote access is access to nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

SUSE Linux Enterprise 16 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.

        A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate
physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the absence.
Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity,
GNOME desktops can be configured to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the
session lock. As such, users should not be allowed to change session settings.

In such cases, recent stores to the same memory location cannot always be observed by later

window.

Since Linux Kernel 4.17 you can check the SSB mitigation state with the following command:

Select the appropriate SSB state by adding the argument
<tt>spec_store_bypass_disable=<tt>prctl</tt></tt> to the default

        By default, the SSH configuration allows any user with an account
to access the system. There are several options available to limit
which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is
recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:
- AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of
  allowing specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of
  space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with
  this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user
  access further by specifically allowing a user's access only from a
  particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host.
- AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of
  allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list
  consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not
  recognized with this variable.
- DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of
  denying specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of

        SUSE Linux Enterprise 16 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br /><br />
For manual installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br /><br />
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <tt>--encrypted</tt> and <tt>--passphrase=</tt> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <tt>--passphrase=</tt> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br /><br />
By default, the <tt>Anaconda</tt> installer uses <tt>aes-xts-plain64</tt> cipher
with a minimum <tt>512</tt> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.
