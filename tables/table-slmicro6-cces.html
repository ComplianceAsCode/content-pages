        Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than
that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage PKI
(public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.

Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate
from the information system, ensures that even if the information system is
compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the
authentication device.

Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information
systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing

        When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory, only the owner of a given file may
remove that file from the directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from
removing each other's files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be
world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's
documentation instead of blindly changing modes.
<br />

<pre>$ sudo chmod +t <i>DIR</i></pre>
