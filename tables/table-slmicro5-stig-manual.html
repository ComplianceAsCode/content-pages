	<td><pre>To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.</pre></td>

Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information.

Every persistent disk partition present must be of type "crypto_LUKS". If any partitions other than the boot partition or pseudo file systems (such as /proc or /sys) or temporary file systems (that are tmpfs) are not type "crypto_LUKS", ask the administrator to indicate how the partitions are encrypted. If there is no evidence that these partitions are encrypted, this is a finding.

	<td><pre>Configure SLEM 5 to prevent unauthorized modification of all information at rest by using disk encryption. 

Encrypting a partition in an already-installed system is more difficult because of the need to resize and change existing partitions. To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the partition layout. The standard partitioning proposal as suggested by YaST (installation and configuration tool for Linux) does not include an encrypted partition by default. Add it manually in the partitioning dialog.

This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with a SLEM 5. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR keyboards, mice, pointing devices, and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DOD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the AO. Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise SLEM 5. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.

Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information.

1) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, SLEM 5 must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

2) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, SLEM 5 must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually.
