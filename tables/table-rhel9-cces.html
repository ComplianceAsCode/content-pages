      <td>Configure Periodic Execution of AIDE</td>
      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        At a minimum, AIDE should be configured to run a weekly scan.
To implement a daily execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following line to <tt>/etc/crontab</tt>:
<pre>05 4 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide --check</pre>
To implement a weekly execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following line to <tt>/etc/crontab</tt>:
<pre>05 4 * * 0 root /usr/sbin/aide --check</pre>
AIDE can be executed periodically through other means; this is merely one example.
The usage of cron's special time codes, such as  <tt>@daily</tt> and
<tt>@weekly</tt> is acceptable.
      </td>
      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        By default, AIDE does not install itself for periodic execution. Periodically
running AIDE is necessary to reveal unexpected changes in installed files.
<br /><br />
Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable
to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to
operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may
be relevant to security.
<br /><br />
Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended,
negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating
system. The operating system's Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information System
Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or
monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

<pre>$ sudo /usr/sbin/aide --init</pre>

By default, the database will be written to the file

<tt>/var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz</tt>.

Storing the database, the configuration file <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>, and the binary
<tt>/usr/sbin/aide</tt>
(or hashes of these files), in a secure location (such as on read-only media) provides additional assurance about their integrity.
The newly-generated database can be installed as follows:

<pre>$ sudo cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz</pre>

To initiate a manual check, run the following command:
<pre>$ sudo /usr/sbin/aide --check</pre>
If this check produces any unexpected output, investigate.

        For AIDE to be effective, an initial database of "known-good" information about files
must be captured and it should be able to be verified against the installed files.

If using a custom ruleset or the <tt>xattrs</tt> option is missing, add <tt>xattrs</tt>
to the appropriate ruleset.
For example, add <tt>xattrs</tt> to the following line in <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>:
<pre>FIPSR = p+i+n+u+g+s+m+c+acl+selinux+xattrs+sha256</pre>
AIDE rules can be configured in multiple ways; this is merely one example that is already
configured by default.

        System running in FIPS mode is indicated by kernel parameter

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 has an installation-time kernel flag that can enable FIPS mode.
The installer must be booted with <tt>fips=1</tt> for the system to have FIPS mode
enabled. Enabling FIPS mode on a preexisting system is not supported. If
this rule fails on an installed system, then this is a permanent
finding and cannot be fixed.



To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel boot
parameters during system installation so key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms
and continuous monitoring tests in place.

        Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords
need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime
of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the
operating system passwords could be compromised.
<br /><br />
Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to
periodically change their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes
increases the risk of users writing down the password in a convenient
location subject to physical compromise.

log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log</pre>
By default, the audit log directory is <tt>/var/log/audit</tt>.
<br />
Configure the audit log directory to be protected from unauthorized read access by setting the
correct permissive mode.
<br />
The appropriate directory permissions depend on the <tt>log_group</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>:
<br />
<ul>
<li>If <tt>log_group</tt> is set to <tt>root</tt> or is not set, the directory should have mode <tt>0700</tt>.
This restricts access to root only, which is the most secure configuration.</li>
<li>If <tt>log_group</tt> is set to a group other than <tt>root</tt>, the directory should have mode <tt>0750</tt>.
This is necessary because when <tt>log_group</tt> is set to a non-root group, the audit log files are
typically configured with mode <tt>0640</tt> (allowing group read access). For group members to access
these files, they need execute permission on the directory to traverse it. The <tt>0750</tt> mode allows
root full access and the specified group read and execute access, while preventing others from accessing
the directory.</li>
</ul>
<br />
If <tt>log_group</tt> is set to a group other than <tt>root</tt>, change the mode of the audit log directory
with the following command:
<pre>$ sudo chmod 0750 audit_log_directory</pre>
Otherwise, change the mode of the audit log directory with the following command:
<pre>$ sudo chmod 0700 audit_log_directory</pre>
Replace <tt><i>audit_log_directory</i></tt> with the correct audit log directory path.

      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        
To configure the system to prevent the <code>squashfs</code>
kernel module from being loaded, add the following line to the file <code>/etc/modprobe.d/squashfs.conf</code>:
<pre>install squashfs /bin/false</pre>
This entry will cause a non-zero return value during a <code>squashfs</code> module installation
and additionally convey the meaning of the entry to the user in form of an error message.
If you would like to omit a non-zero return value and an error message, you may want to add a different line instead
(both <code>/bin/true</code> and <code>/bin/false</code> are allowed by OVAL and will be accepted by the scan):
<pre>install squashfs /bin/true</pre>

This effectively prevents usage of this uncommon filesystem.

The <tt>squashfs</tt> filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux
filesystem embedded in small footprint systems (similar to
<tt>cramfs</tt>). A <tt>squashfs</tt> image can be used without having
to first decompress the image.

      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory, only the owner of a given file may
remove that file from the directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from
removing each other's files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be
world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's
documentation instead of blindly changing modes.
<br />
To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory <i>DIR</i>, run the following command:
<pre>$ sudo chmod +t <i>DIR</i></pre>
      </td>
      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to delete files
in the directory structure.
<br /><br />
The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the
system, or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally reserved
for directories used by the system, by users for temporary file storage (such as <tt>/tmp</tt>),
and for directories requiring global read/write access.

Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services.
Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support

Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component

The customization mechanism provided by crypto policies appends eventual customizations at the end of the system wide crypto policy.

        Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when
presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It
is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor;
it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the
subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted
root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for
certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is
necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any
certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes
certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.
Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.

        Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a
critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit
information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings,

activity.

Audit tools include but are not limited to vendor-provided and open-source
audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
generators.

It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code
into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system
activity from the audit logs.

To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to
provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,
manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or

To disable merging of slabs in the Kernel add the argument <tt>slab_nomerge=yes</tt>
to the default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.
To ensure that <tt>slab_nomerge=yes</tt> is added as a kernel command line

default Grub2 command line for Linux operating systems. Modify the line within

Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:<pre># grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="slab_nomerge=yes"</pre>
If the system is distributed as a bootable container image, GRUB2 can't be configured using the method described above, but the following method needs to be used instead.

Note that even if the check fails, your kernel is possibly still fine, as W+X mappings are not
a security hole in themselves, what they do is that they make the exploitation of other unfixed
kernel bugs easier.

        L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) is a hardware vulnerability which allows unprivileged
speculative access to data which is available in the Level 1 Data Cache when
the page table entry isn't present.

Select the appropriate mitigation by adding the argument
<tt>l1tf=<tt>flush</tt></tt> to the default
GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.
To ensure that <tt>l1tf=<tt>flush</tt></tt> is added as a kernel command line
argument to newly installed kernels, add <tt>l1tf=<tt>flush</tt></tt> to the
default Grub2 command line for Linux operating systems. Modify the line within
<tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> as shown below:
<pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="... l1tf=<tt>flush</tt> ..."</pre>
Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:<pre># grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="l1tf=<tt>flush</tt>"</pre>
If the system is distributed as a bootable container image, GRUB2 can't be configured using the method described above, but the following method needs to be used instead.
The kernel arguments should be set in <tt>/usr/lib/bootc/kargs.d</tt> in a TOML file that has the following form:
<pre>
# /usr/lib/bootc/kargs.d/10-example.toml
kargs = ["l1tf=<tt>flush</tt>"]
</pre>
For more details on configuring kernel arguments in bootable container images, please refer to <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc//building/kernel-arguments.html'>Bootc documentation</a>.

Since Linux Kernel 4.19 you can check the L1TF vulnerability state with the
following command:
<tt>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf</tt>

      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        The L1TF vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass memory access security controls imposed

        A network port is identified by its number, the associated IP address,

A listening port is a network port on which an application or process 
listens on, acting as a communication endpoint.
Each listening port can be open or closed (filtered) using a firewall. 
In general terms, an open port is a network port that accepts 
incoming packets from remote locations.

      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        Certain CPUs are vulnerable to an exploit against a common wide industry wide performance
optimization known as Speculative Store Bypass (SSB).

In such cases, recent stores to the same memory location cannot always be observed by later
loads during speculative execution. However, such stores are unlikely and thus they can be
detected prior to instruction retirement at the end of a particular speculation execution
window.

Since Linux Kernel 4.17 you can check the SSB mitigation state with the following command:
<tt>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass</tt>

Select the appropriate SSB state by adding the argument
<tt>spec_store_bypass_disable=<tt>prctl</tt></tt> to the default
GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.
To ensure that <tt>spec_store_bypass_disable=<tt>prctl</tt></tt> is added as a kernel command line
argument to newly installed kernels, add <tt>spec_store_bypass_disable=<tt>prctl</tt></tt> to the
default Grub2 command line for Linux operating systems. Modify the line within
<tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> as shown below:
<pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="... spec_store_bypass_disable=<tt>prctl</tt> ..."</pre>
Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:<pre># grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="spec_store_bypass_disable=<tt>prctl</tt>"</pre>
If the system is distributed as a bootable container image, GRUB2 can't be configured using the method described above, but the following method needs to be used instead.
The kernel arguments should be set in <tt>/usr/lib/bootc/kargs.d</tt> in a TOML file that has the following form:
<pre>
# /usr/lib/bootc/kargs.d/10-example.toml
kargs = ["spec_store_bypass_disable=<tt>prctl</tt>"]

        Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br /><br />
For manual installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br /><br />
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <tt>--encrypted</tt> and <tt>--passphrase=</tt> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <tt>--passphrase=</tt> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br /><br />
By default, the <tt>Anaconda</tt> installer uses <tt>aes-xts-plain64</tt> cipher
with a minimum <tt>512</tt> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

<br /><br />
