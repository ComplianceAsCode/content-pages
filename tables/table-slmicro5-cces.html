        Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than
that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage PKI
(public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.

Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate
from the information system, ensures that even if the information system is
compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the
authentication device.

Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information
systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing
time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards
or similar secure authentication devices issued by an organization or identity provider.

that allowed recovery of up to 32 bits of plaintext from a block of ciphertext that was
encrypted with the Cipher Block Chaining (CBD) method. From that research, new Counter

windows systems and portable USB drives or flash modules. It comes
in three types <tt>FAT12</tt>, <tt>FAT16</tt>, and <tt>FAT32</tt>
all of which are supported by the <tt>vfat</tt> kernel module.

Remote access is access to nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro 5 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.
Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets)."
