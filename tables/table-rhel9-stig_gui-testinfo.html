This profile contains configuration checks that align to the
DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 V2R7.

In addition to being applicable to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, this
configuration baseline is applicable to the operating system tier of
Red Hat technologies that are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, such as:

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation and Desktop
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux for HPC
- Red Hat Storage
- Red Hat Containers with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 image

Warning: The installation and use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
increases your attack vector and decreases your overall security posture. If
your Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) lacks a documented operational
requirement for a graphical user interface, please consider using the
standard DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 profile.

    <td>The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as
laptops, places its data at risk of compromise.  Encrypting this data mitigates
the risk of its loss if the system is lost.</td>
    <td>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br /><br />
For manual installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br /><br />
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <tt>--encrypted</tt> and <tt>--passphrase=</tt> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <tt>--passphrase=</tt> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br /><br />
By default, the <tt>Anaconda</tt> installer uses <tt>aes-xts-plain64</tt> cipher
with a minimum <tt>512</tt> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

<br /><br />
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Documentation web site:<br />

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor;
it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the
subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted
root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is
necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any
