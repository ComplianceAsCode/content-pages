from the final system's security point of view. The guidance is specified in the Security
Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) format and constitutes a catalog of practical hardening
advice, linked to government requirements where applicable. The SCAP Security Guide project
bridges the gap between generalized policy requirements and specific implementation guidelines.
A system administrator can use the <tt>oscap</tt> CLI tool from the <tt>openscap-scanner</tt>
package, or the SCAP Workbench GUI tool from the <tt>scap-workbench</tt> package, to verify
that the system conforms to provided guidelines. Refer to the scap-security-guide(8) manual

Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.
To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.

Remote access is access to nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Oracle Linux 7 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.

        Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
Requiring a minimum number of special characters makes password guessing attacks
more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.
