Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) format and constitutes a catalog of practical hardening
advice, linked to government requirements where applicable. The SCAP Security Guide project
bridges the gap between generalized policy requirements and specific implementation guidelines.
A system administrator can use the <tt>oscap</tt> CLI tool from the <tt>openscap-scanner</tt>

that the system conforms to provided guidelines. Refer to the scap-security-guide(8) manual

        Configure some basic <tt>Audit</tt> parameters specific for OSPP profile.
In particular, configure <tt>Audit</tt> to watch for direct modification of files storing system user and group information, and usage of applications with special rights which can change system configuration.
Further audited events include access to audit log it self, attempts to Alter Process and Session Initiation Information, and attempts to modify MAC controls.

A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.
The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined.
Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session can be locked, Oracle Linux 7 needs to provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity.
Instruct users to begin new terminal sessions with the following command:
<pre>$ tmux</pre>
The console can now be locked with the following key combination:
<pre>ctrl+b :lock-session</pre>

        In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.
Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.
To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.
