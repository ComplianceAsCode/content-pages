      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        The <tt>auditd</tt> service is an essential userspace component of
the Linux Auditing System, as it is responsible for writing audit records to
disk.

The <code>auditd</code> service can be enabled with the following manifest:
<pre>
---
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
  name: 75-master-auditd-enable
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.1.0
    systemd:
      units:
      - name: auditd.service
        enabled: true
</pre>
<p>
This will enable the <tt>auditd</tt> service in all the
nodes labeled with the "master" role.
</p>
<p>
Note that this needs to be done for each <tt>MachineConfigPool</tt>
</p>
<p>
For more information on how to configure nodes with the Machine Config
Operator see
<a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.html'>the relevant documentation</a>.

        Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult
to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.
Ensuring the <tt>auditd</tt> service is active ensures audit records
generated by the kernel are appropriately recorded.
<br /><br />
Additionally, a properly configured audit subsystem ensures that actions of
individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they
can be held accountable for their actions.

      <td>Set SSH Client Alive Count Max</td>
      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        The SSH server sends at most <tt>ClientAliveCountMax</tt> messages
during a SSH session and waits for a response from the SSH client.
The option <tt>ClientAliveInterval</tt> configures timeout after
each <tt>ClientAliveCountMax</tt> message. If the SSH server does not
receive a response from the client, then the connection is considered unresponsive
and terminated.
For SSH earlier than v8.2, a <tt>ClientAliveCountMax</tt> value of <tt>0</tt>
causes a timeout precisely when the <tt>ClientAliveInterval</tt> is set.
Starting with v8.2, a value of <tt>0</tt> disables the timeout functionality
completely. If the option is set to a number greater than <tt>0</tt>, then
the session will be disconnected after
<tt>ClientAliveInterval * ClientAliveCountMax</tt> seconds without receiving
a keep alive message.
      </td>
      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        This ensures a user login will be terminated as soon as the <tt>ClientAliveInterval</tt>

        In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.
Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.
To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.

Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.

Remote access is access to nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 4 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.
Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets)."

To override the system wide crypto policy for Openssh client, place a file in the <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/</tt> so that it is loaded before the <tt>05-redhat.conf</tt>. In this case it is file named <tt>02-ospp.conf</tt> containing parameters which need to be changed with respect to the crypto policy.
This rule checks if the file exists and if it contains required parameters and values which modify the Crypto Policy.
During the parsing process, as soon as Openssh client parses some configuration option and its value, it remembers it and ignores any subsequent overrides. The customization mechanism provided by crypto policies appends eventual customizations at the end of the system wide crypto policy. Therefore, if the crypto policy customization overrides some parameter which is already configured in the system wide crypto policy, the SSH client will not honor that customized parameter.

      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        The Common Criteria requirements specify how certain parameters for OpenSSH Client are configured. Particular parameters are RekeyLimit, GSSAPIAuthentication, Ciphers, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes, MACs and KexAlgorithms. Currently particular requirements specified by CC are stricter compared to any existing Crypto Policy.

directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from
removing each other's files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be
world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's
documentation instead of blindly changing modes.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) is a single-purpose container
operating system. RHCOS is only supported as a component of the
OpenShift Container Platform. Remote management of the RHCOS nodes is
performed at the OpenShift Container Platform API level. As a result,
any direct remote access to the RHCOS nodes is unnecessary. Disabling
the SSHD service helps reduce the number of open ports on each host.
