        Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against
the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most

reauthenticates. No other activity aside from reauthentication must

removing each other's files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be

bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's
documentation instead of blindly changing modes.

Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.

Remote access is access to nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.
Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets)."

        SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br /><br />
For manual installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br /><br />
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Documentation web site:<br />

defeat the organization's policy regarding password reuse.

        Without cryptographic integrity protections, system executables and files can be altered by
unauthorized users without detection. The RPM package management system can check the hashes
of installed software packages, including many that are important to system security.

To verify that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands matches vendor values, run
the following command to list which files on the system have hashes that differ from what is
expected by the RPM database:
<pre>$ rpm -Va --noconfig | grep '^..5'</pre>

If the file was not expected to change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs
or other means. The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file. Run the following
command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>

The package can be reinstalled from a zypper repository using the command:
<pre>$ sudo zypper reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

that the NTP daemon will be running and that the system will synchronize its
time to any servers specified. This is important whether the system is

acting as an NTP server to other systems.  Synchronizing time is essential for
authentication services such as Kerberos, but it is also important for

        Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users,
or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and
ongoing concern that can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the
risk from insider and advanced persistent threats.

Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks, which attempt to subvert
their normal role of providing some necessary but limited capability. As such, motivation
exists to monitor these programs for unusual activity.

        Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts,
is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify
the risk from insider and advanced persistent threats.

Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks,
which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary but
limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for
unusual activity.

By default, the audit log directory is <tt>/var/log/audit</tt>.

Configure the audit log directory to be protected from unauthorized read access by setting the

<br />
<ul>
<li>If <tt>log_group</tt> is set to <tt>root</tt> or is not set, the directory should have mode <tt>0700</tt>.

This is necessary because when <tt>log_group</tt> is set to a non-root group, the audit log files are
typically configured with mode <tt>0640</tt> (allowing group read access). For group members to access
these files, they need execute permission on the directory to traverse it. The <tt>0750</tt> mode allows
root full access and the specified group read and execute access, while preventing others from accessing
the directory.</li>
</ul>

If <tt>log_group</tt> is set to a group other than <tt>root</tt>, change the mode of the audit log directory
