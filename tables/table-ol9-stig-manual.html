	<td>SRG-OS-000780-GPOS-00240</td>
	<td><pre>Operating systems handling data requiring "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest. 
 
Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).</pre></td>
	<td><pre>Note: If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data at rest encryption, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Verify that OL 9 prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information requiring at rest protection by using disk encryption.

Determine the partition layout for the system with the following command: 
 
$ sudo fdisk -l 
(..) 
Disk /dev/vda: 15 GiB, 16106127360 bytes, 31457280 sectors 
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes 
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes 
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes 
Disklabel type: gpt 
Disk identifier: 83298450-B4E3-4B19-A9E4-7DF147A5FEFB 
 
Device       Start      End  Sectors Size Type 
/dev/vda1     2048     4095     2048   1M BIOS boot 
/dev/vda2     4096  2101247  2097152   1G Linux filesystem 
/dev/vda3  2101248 31455231 29353984  14G Linux filesystem 
(...) 
 
Verify that the system partitions are all encrypted with the following command: 
 
$ sudo more /etc/crypttab 
 
Every persistent disk partition present must have an entry in the file. 
 
If any partitions other than the boot partition or pseudo file systems (such as /proc or /sys) are not listed, this is a finding.</pre></td>
	<td><pre>Configure the OL 9 operating system to implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modification of all information at rest.

To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the partition layout. 
 
Note: Encrypting a partition in an already-installed system is more difficult because it will need to be resized and existing partitions changed.</pre></td>

To verify Oracle Linux Downloads, users need:
-A checksum file corresponding to the downloaded ISO.
-The public GPG key to verify the Oracle key used to sign the checksum file.

The checksum file contains a list of files that are part of a download package with the corresponding checksums as well as a GPG signature. The GPG signature enables anyone to verify that checksum file was published by Oracle. The steps below describe how to verify they checksum file itself and then verify the contents of the Oracle Linux download by checking against the checksum file.

Import the Oracle Linux GPG key corresponding to the Oracle Linux release:

$ curl https://yum.oracle.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle-ol9 | gpg --import

Note: No "sudo" for curl command

Download the appropriate checksum file and place it in the same directory as the Oracle Linux ISO download:

$ curl https://linux.oracle.com/security/gpg/checksum/OracleLinux-R9-U3-Server-x86_64.checksum > OracleLinux-R9-U3-Server-x86_64.checksum

Download GPG Key:

 $ curl https://yum.oracle.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle-ol9 -o RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle
Note: No "sudo" for curl command

To verify the checksum file:

$ gpg --verify-files OracleLinux-R9-U3-Server-x86_64.checksum
gpg: Signature made Wed 15 Nov 2023 07:22:32 AM EST

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

	<td><pre>Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

	<td><pre>Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open-source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.

It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs.

To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a certification authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to increase exponentially the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.

OL 9 uses "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. Configurations are set in the "etc/security/pwquality.conf" file.

The "minlen", sometimes noted as minimum length, acts as a "score" of complexity based on the credit components of the "pwquality" module. By setting the credit components to a negative value, not only will those components be required, but they will not count toward the total "score" of "minlen". This will enable "minlen" to require a 15-character minimum.

	<td><pre>To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

Emergency accounts are not subject to manual removal or scheduled expiration requirements.

The automatic expiration of temporary accounts may be extended as needed by the circumstances, but it must not be extended indefinitely. A documented permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.
