	<td><pre>The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as
laptops, places its data at risk of compromise.  Encrypting this data mitigates
the risk of its loss if the system is lost.</pre></td>
	<td><pre>Check the system partitions to determine if they are encrypted with the following command:
blkid

Output will be similar to:
/dev/sda1: UUID=" ab12c3de-4f56-789a-8f33-3850cc8ce3a2
" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
/dev/sda2: UUID=" bc98d7ef-6g54-321h-1d24-9870de2ge1a2
" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"

The boot partition and pseudo-file systems, such as /proc, /sys, and tmpfs,
are not required to use disk encryption and are not a finding.
      Is it the case that partitions do not have a type of crypto_LUKS?
      </pre></td>
	<td><pre>Oracle Linux 9 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.

        
For manual installations, select the Encrypt checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.


        
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the --encrypted and --passphrase= options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=PASSPHRASE
        
Any PASSPHRASE is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the --passphrase= option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.

        
By default, the Anaconda installer uses aes-xts-plain64 cipher
with a minimum 512 bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.


        
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Oracle Linux 9 Documentation web site:

Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.

Remote access is access to nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Oracle Linux 9 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.
Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets)."</pre></td>

system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report

It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code
into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system
activity from the audit logs.

provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,

subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted
root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is

are not required to use disk encryption and are not a finding.
      Is it the case that partitions do not have a type of crypto_LUKS?
      </pre></td>
	<td><pre>Oracle Linux 9 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.

        
For manual installations, select the Encrypt checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.


        
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the --encrypted and --passphrase= options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=PASSPHRASE
        
Any PASSPHRASE is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the --passphrase= option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.

        
By default, the Anaconda installer uses aes-xts-plain64 cipher
with a minimum 512 bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.


        
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on

world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's
documentation instead of blindly changing modes.
