This profile contains configuration checks that align to the
DISA STIG with GUI for Oracle Linux V3R1.

Warning: The installation and use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
increases your attack vector and decreases your overall security posture. If
your Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) lacks a documented operational
requirement for a graphical user interface, please consider using the
standard DISA STIG for Oracle Linux 7 profile.

configured to use removable media as the boot loader.</td>
    <td>The system must not allow removable media to be used as the boot loader.
Remove alternate methods of booting the system from removable media.

    <td><pre>To verify the system is not configured to use a boot loader on removable media,
check that the grub configuration file has the set root command in each menu
entry with the following commands:
<pre>$ sudo grep -cw menuentry /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg</pre>
Note that the <pre>-c</pre> option for the <pre>grep</pre> command will print
only the count of <pre>menuentry</pre> occurrences. This number should match
the number of occurrences reported by the following command:
<pre>$ sudo grep "set root='hd0" /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg</pre>
The output should return something similar to:
<pre>set root='hd0,msdos1'</pre>

    <td>Deactivate Wireless Network Interfaces</td>
    <td>The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors into
the organization's network. Common attack vectors such as malicious association
and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point
(AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the
attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also
serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of
service to valid network resources.</td>
    <td>Deactivating wireless network interfaces should prevent normal usage of the wireless
capability.

Configure the system to disable all wireless network interfaces with the following command:
<pre>$ sudo nmcli radio all off</pre></td>
    <td><pre>Verify that there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system
with the following command:

Note: This requirement is Not Applicable for systems that do not have physical wireless network radios.
