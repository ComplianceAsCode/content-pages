  <h2>SYS.1.6.A1: Planning Container Use</h2>
  <p>Description: (1) Before containers are deployed, the goal of such a deployment (e.g. scaling, availability, disposable containers for safety or CI/CD) SHOULD be determined so that all the security- related aspects of installation, operation, and decommissioning can be planned. (2) The planning SHOULD also take into account the operational overhead resulting from container deployment or mixed operation. (3) The planning MUST be adequately documented</p>

  <h2>SYS.1.6.A2: Container Management Planning</h2>
  <p>Description: (1) The management of containers MUST ONLY be carried out in line with appropriate planning. (2) This planning MUST cover the entire lifecycle from commissioning to decommissioning, including operation and updates. (3) When planning container management, it MUST be taken into account that the creator of a container is to be considered like an administrator due to the effects they have on parts of the operation. (4) Containers MUST be started, stopped, and monitored via the management software used.</p>

  <h2>SYS.1.6.A3: Secure Use of Containerised IT Systems</h2>
  <p>Description: (1) In the case of containerised IT systems, consideration MUST be given to how containerisation affects the IT systems and applications operated, in particular the management and suitability of the applications. (2) Based on the protection needs of the applications, it MUST be checked whether the requirements for isolation and encapsulation of the containerised IT systems, virtual networks, and operated applications are sufficiently fulfilled. (3) The mechanisms of the operating system in question SHOULD be included in this check. (4) Since the host performs the function of a network component for virtual networks, the modules of the sub-layers NET.1 Networks and NET.3 Network Components MUST be considered accordingly. (5) Logical and overlay networks MUST also be considered and modelled. (6) Furthermore, the containerised IT systems used MUST meet the requirements at hand regarding availability and data throughput.(7) During operation, the performance and the state of the containerised IT systems SHOULD be monitored (health checks).</p>
