VPN to protect insecure services such as NetBIOS, file-sharing, Telnet, FTP, etc.

Note: SSL and early TLS are not considered strong cryptography and
cannot be used as a security control after June 30, 2016. Prior to this date,
existing implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk
Mitigation and Migration Plan in place.

Effective immediately, new implementations must not use SSL or early TLS.

POS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect) that
can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early
TLS may continue using these as a security control after June 30, 2016.'</p>

consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking
vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score,
and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.

Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings
will vary based on an organization's environment and risk- assessment strategy.
Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered
to be a 'high risk' to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking,
vulnerabilities may be considered 'critical' if they pose an imminent
threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a
potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include
security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems
that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.</p>
