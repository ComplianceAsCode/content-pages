<h2>Rule details</h2>


<div id="clean_components_post_updating" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure dnf Removes Previous Package Versions</h3>
<div>clean_components_post_updating</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p><tt>dnf</tt> should be configured to remove previous software components after
new versions have been installed. To configure <tt>dnf</tt> to remove the

previous software components after updating, set the <tt>clean_requirements_on_remove</tt>


to <tt>1</tt> in <tt>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Previous versions of software components that are not removed from the information
system after updates have been installed may be exploited by some adversaries.</p>
</div>

<div id="dnf-automatic_apply_updates" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Configure dnf-automatic to Install Available Updates Automatically</h3>
<div>dnf-automatic_apply_updates</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To ensure that the packages comprising the available updates will be automatically installed by <tt>dnf-automatic</tt>, set <tt>apply_updates</tt> to <tt>yes</tt> under <tt>[commands]</tt> section in <tt>/etc/dnf/automatic.conf</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against
the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most
recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized
users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The
lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.
The automated installation of updates ensures that recent security patches
are applied in a timely manner.</p>
</div>

<div id="dnf-automatic_security_updates_only" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Configure dnf-automatic to Install Only Security Updates</h3>
<div>dnf-automatic_security_updates_only</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To configure <tt>dnf-automatic</tt> to install only security updates
automatically, set <tt>upgrade_type</tt> to <tt>security</tt> under
<tt>[commands]</tt> section in <tt>/etc/dnf/automatic.conf</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>By default, <tt>dnf-automatic</tt> installs all available updates.
Reducing the amount of updated packages only to updates that were
issued as a part of a security advisory increases the system stability.</p>
</div>

<div id="enable_gpgcheck_for_all_repositories" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure gpgcheck Is Enabled for All Package Repositories</h3>
<div>enable_gpgcheck_for_all_repositories</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To ensure signature checking is enabled for all package repositories, the
<tt>gpgcheck</tt> option must be enabled for all repos.
Configure the operating system to verify the signature of packages from
a repository prior to install by setting the following option in
the <tt>"/etc/yum.repos.d/[your_repo_name].repo"</tt> file:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by
a trusted vendor.</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_GPG_keys_are_configured" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure GPG keys are configured</h3>
<div>ensure_GPG_keys_are_configured</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The operation system or installed application can be successfully bootstrapped
without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new packages or
update them until the keys are trusted.
<br /><br />
Most packages managers implement GPG key signing to verify package integrity
during installation.
<br /><br />
To verify GPG keys are configured correctly for your package manager,
one of the following command groups may provide the needed information
depending on the package manager in use.
<br /><br />
In SUSE Linux distributions, the administrators have to follow the next steps: <br />
1. Log on to the system as a user with administrator rights.<br />
2. Locate and download package, for example zoom_x86_64.rpm<br />
3. Locate and download the public key (GPG) from the software download site, for
example the key for zoom package is package-signing-key-5-12-6.pub<br />
4. Import the key public key:<br />
<tt>$ sudo rpm --import package-signing-key-5-12-6.pub</tt><br />
5. List the keys, for example the command:<br />
<tt>$ sudo rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</tt><br />
will provide:<br />
<tt>gpg-pubkey-dd79b481-62fe7502</tt><br />
6. Get more details about the key, via the command:<br />
<tt>$ sudo rpm -qa gpg-pubkey-dd79b481-62fe7502</tt><br />
7. Check the GPG key, for example the command:<br />
<tt>$ sudo rpm -q gpg-pubkey --qf '%{name}-%{version}-%{release} --&gt; %{summary}\n'</tt><br />
will provide:<br />
<tt>gpg-pubkey-dd79b481-62fe7502 --&gt; gpg(Zoom Video Communications, Inc. &lt;CryptoOpsCodeSignProd@zoom.us&gt;)</tt><br />
<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>It is important to ensure that updates are obtained from a valid source to protect
against spoofing that could lead to the inadvertent installation of malware on the
system.</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_fedora_gpgkey_installed" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure Fedora GPG Key Installed</h3>
<div>ensure_fedora_gpgkey_installed</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software
packages come from Fedora (and to connect to the Fedora Network to
receive them), the Fedora GPG key must properly be installed.
To install the Fedora GPG key, run one of the commands below, depending on your Fedora version:
<pre>$ sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora--primary</pre>"
<pre>$ sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora--primary</pre>"</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Changes to software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures
the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided
by a trusted vendor. The Fedora GPG key is necessary to
cryptographically verify packages are from Fedora."</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_gpgcheck_globally_activated" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled In Main dnf Configuration</h3>
<div>ensure_gpgcheck_globally_activated</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option controls whether
RPM packages' signatures are always checked prior to installation.
To configure dnf to check package signatures before installing
them, ensure the following line appears in <tt>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</tt> in
the <tt>[main]</tt> section:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a
trusted vendor.
<br />
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system
components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the
organization.
<br />Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation
validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor.
This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been
provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by
this requirement. Certificates used to verify the software must be from an
approved Certificate Authority (CA).</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_gpgcheck_local_packages" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled for Local Packages</h3>
<div>ensure_gpgcheck_local_packages</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p><tt>dnf</tt> should be configured to verify the signature(s) of local packages
prior to installation. To configure <tt>dnf</tt> to verify signatures of local
packages, set the <tt>localpkg_gpgcheck</tt> to <tt>1</tt> in <tt>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Changes to any software components can have significant effects to the overall security
of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered and
has been provided by a trusted vendor.
<br /><br />
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must
be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_gpgcheck_never_disabled" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled for All dnf Package Repositories</h3>
<div>ensure_gpgcheck_never_disabled</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To ensure signature checking is not disabled for
any repos, remove any lines from files in <tt>/etc/yum.repos.d</tt> of the form:
<pre>gpgcheck=0</pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates
the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This ensures
the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a
trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this
requirement. Certificates used to verify the software must be from an
approved Certificate Authority (CA)."</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_gpgcheck_repo_metadata" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled for Repository Metadata</h3>
<div>ensure_gpgcheck_repo_metadata</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Verify the operating system prevents the installation of patches,
service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of
local packages without verification of the repository metadata.
Check that <tt>dnf</tt> verifies the repository
metadata prior to install with the following command.
This should be configured by setting <tt>repo_gpgcheck</tt> to <tt>1</tt>
in <tt>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Changes to any software components can have significant effects to the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
software has not been tampered and has been provided by a trusted vendor.
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system
components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by
the organization. Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to
installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from
a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it
has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are
disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have
to verify the software again. NOTE: For U.S. Military systems, this
requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however,
the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved
Certificate Authority.</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_oracle_gpgkey_installed" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure Oracle Linux GPG Key Installed</h3>
<div>ensure_oracle_gpgkey_installed</div>
<h4>Description</h4>

packages come from Oracle (and to connect to the Unbreakable Linux Network to
receive them), the Oracle GPG key must properly be installed.
To install the Oracle GPG key, run:
<pre>$ sudo uln_register</pre>
If the system is not connected to the Internet,
then install the Oracle GPG key from trusted media such as
the Oracle installation CD-ROM or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted
in <tt>/media/cdrom</tt>, use the following command as the root user to import
it into the keyring:
<pre>$ sudo rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle</pre>

Alternatively, the key may be pre-loaded during the Oracle installation. In
such cases, the key can be installed by running the following command:

</div>

<div id="rpm_verify_crypto_policies" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Verify crypto-policies with RPM</h3>
<div>rpm_verify_crypto_policies</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Without cryptographic integrity protections, system executables and files can be altered by
unauthorized users without detection. The RPM package management system can check the hashes
of installed software packages, including many that are important to system security.

If the file was not expected to change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs
or other means. The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file. Run the following
command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>

The package can be reinstalled from a dnf repository using the command:
<pre>$ sudo dnf reinstall crypto-policies</pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>The crypto-policies package defines the cryptography policies for the system.
If the files are changed from those shipped with the operating system, 
It may be possible for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 to use cryptographic functions that are not FIPS 140-3 approved.</p>
</div>

<div id="rpm_verify_hashes" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Verify File Hashes with RPM</h3>
<div>rpm_verify_hashes</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Without cryptographic integrity protections, system executables and files can be altered by
unauthorized users without detection. The RPM package management system can check the hashes
of installed software packages, including many that are important to system security.

To verify that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands matches vendor values, run
the following command to list which files on the system have hashes that differ from what is
expected by the RPM database:
<pre>$ rpm -Va --noconfig | grep '^..5'</pre>

If the file was not expected to change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs
or other means. The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file. Run the following
command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>

The package can be reinstalled from a dnf repository using the command:
<pre>$ sudo dnf reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:
<pre>$ sudo rpm -Uvh <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>The hashes of important files like system executables should match the
information given by the RPM database. Executables with erroneous hashes could
be a sign of nefarious activity on the system.</p>
</div>

<div id="rpm_verify_ownership" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Verify and Correct Ownership with RPM</h3>
<div>rpm_verify_ownership</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The RPM package management system can check file ownership permissions of installed software
packages, including many that are important to system security. After locating a file with
incorrect permissions, which can be found with:
<pre>rpm -Va | awk '{ if (substr($0,6,1)=="U" || substr($0,7,1)=="G") print $NF }'</pre>
run the following command to determine which package owns it:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
Next, run the following command to reset its permissions to the correct values:
<pre>$ sudo rpm --restore <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Ownership of binaries and configuration files that is incorrect could allow an unauthorized
user to gain privileges that they should not have. The ownership set by the vendor should be
maintained. Any deviations from this baseline should be investigated.</p>
</div>

<div id="rpm_verify_permissions" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Verify and Correct File Permissions with RPM</h3>
<div>rpm_verify_permissions</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The RPM package management system can check file access permissions of installed software
packages, including many that are important to system security. Verify that the file
permissions of system files and commands match vendor values. Check the file permissions with
the following command:
<pre>$ sudo rpm -Va | awk '{ if (substr($0,2,1)=="M") print $NF }'</pre>
Output indicates files that do not match vendor defaults.

After locating a file with incorrect permissions, run the following command to determine which
package owns it:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
<br />
Next, run the following command to reset its permissions to the correct values:
<pre>$ sudo rpm --restore <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Permissions on system binaries and configuration files that are too generous could allow an
unauthorized user to gain privileges that they should not have. The permissions set by the
vendor should be maintained. Any deviations from this baseline should be investigated.</p>
</div>

<div id="security_patches_up_to_date" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure Software Patches Installed</h3>
<div>security_patches_up_to_date</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,
or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
<pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
can be manually downloaded from the Red Hat Network and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.

<br /><br />
NOTE: U.S. Defense systems are required to be patched within 30 days or sooner as local policy
dictates.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against
the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most
recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized
users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The
lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.</p>
