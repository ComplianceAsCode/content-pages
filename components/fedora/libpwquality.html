<h2>Rule details</h2>


<div id="accounts_password_pam_dcredit" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Digit Characters</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_dcredit</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>dcredit</tt> parameter controls requirements for
usage of digits in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to
contain that many digits. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional
length credit for each digit. Modify the <tt>dcredit</tt> setting in
<tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to require the use of a digit in passwords.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
attacks.
<br /><br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
Requiring digits makes password guessing attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger
search space.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_dictcheck" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Prevent the Use of Dictionary Words</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_dictcheck</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>dictcheck</tt> check if passwords contains dictionary words. When
<tt>dictcheck</tt> is set to <tt>1</tt> passwords will be checked for dictionary words.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
guessing and brute-force attacks.
<br /><br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more
complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
password is compromised.
<br /><br />
Passwords with dictionary words may be more vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_difok" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Different Characters</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_difok</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>difok</tt> parameter sets the number of characters
in a password that must not be present in and old password during a password change.
<br /><br />
Modify the <tt>difok</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt>
to equal <tt>$var_password_pam_difok</tt> to require differing characters
when changing passwords.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength,
is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts
at guessing and bruteâ€“force attacks.
<br /><br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long
it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the
greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested
before the password is compromised.
<br /><br />
Requiring a minimum number of different characters during password changes ensures that
newly changed passwords should not resemble previously compromised ones.
Note that passwords which are changed on compromised systems will still be compromised, however.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_enforce_local" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Enforce for Local Accounts Only</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_enforce_local</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>local_users_only</tt> parameter controls requirements for
enforcing password complexity by pam_pwquality only for local user accounts and ignoring
centralized user account management password complexity configurations. Enable the <tt>local_users_only</tt>
setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to require password complexity enforcement
for only local user accounts.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>The operating system must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account management
functions. Enterprise environments make application account management challenging and
complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential
oversight or other error.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_enforce_root" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Enforce for root User</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_enforce_root</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>enforce_for_root</tt> parameter controls requirements for
enforcing password complexity for the root user. Enable the <tt>enforce_for_root</tt>
setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to require the <tt>root</tt> user
to use complex passwords.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise
the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a
password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations
that need to be tested before the password is compromised.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_enforcing" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Enforcing</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_enforcing</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Verify that the operating system uses "pwquality" to enforce the
password complexity rules.

Verify the pwquality module is being enforced by operating system by
running the following command:
<pre>
$ grep -i enforcing /etc/security/pwquality.conf
enforcing = 1
</pre>

If the value of "enforcing" is not "1" or the line is commented out,
this is a finding.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength,
is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
guessing and brute-force attacks. Using enforcing=1 ensures "pwquality"
enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability
to limit brute-force attacks on the system.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_lcredit" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Lowercase Characters</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_lcredit</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>lcredit</tt> parameter controls requirements for
usage of lowercase letters in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to
contain that many lowercase characters. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional
length credit for each lowercase character. Modify the <tt>lcredit</tt> setting in
<tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to require the use of a lowercase character in passwords.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
attacks.
<br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
Requiring a minimum number of lowercase characters makes password guessing attacks
more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_maxclassrepeat" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Maximum Consecutive Repeating Characters from Same Character Class</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_maxclassrepeat</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>maxclassrepeat</tt> parameter controls requirements for
consecutive repeating characters from the same character class. When set to a positive number, it will reject passwords
which contain more than that number of consecutive characters from the same character class. Modify the
<tt>maxclassrepeat</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to equal <tt>$var_password_pam_maxclassrepeat</tt>
to prevent a run of (<tt>$var_password_pam_maxclassrepeat</tt> + 1) or more identical characters.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting
attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
<br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The
more complex a password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
password is compromised.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_maxrepeat" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Set Password Maximum Consecutive Repeating Characters</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_maxrepeat</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>maxrepeat</tt> parameter controls requirements for
consecutive repeating characters. When set to a positive number, it will reject passwords
which contain more than that number of consecutive characters. Modify the <tt>maxrepeat</tt> setting
in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to equal <tt>$var_password_pam_maxrepeat</tt> to prevent a
run of (<tt>$var_password_pam_maxrepeat</tt> + 1) or more identical characters.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
guessing and brute-force attacks.
<br /><br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more
complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
password is compromised.
<br /><br />
Passwords with excessive repeating characters may be more vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_maxsequence" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Limit the maximum number of sequential characters in passwords</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_maxsequence</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The <tt>pwquality maxsequence</tt> setting defines the maximum allowable length for consecutive 
character sequences in a new password. Such sequences can be, e.g., 123 or abc. If the value is 
set to 0, this check will be turned off.
<br /><br />
Note: Passwords that consist mainly of such sequences are unlikely to meet the simplicity criteria 
unless the sequence constitutes only a small portion of the overall password.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a strong password helps to increase the time and resources required to
compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the
effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
<br /><br />
Password complexity is one important factor that determines the duration required to crack it.
A more intricate password results in a larger number of potential combinations that must be 
tested before successfully compromising the password.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_minclass" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Different Categories</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_minclass</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>minclass</tt> parameter controls
requirements for usage of different character classes, or types, of character
that must exist in a password before it is considered valid. For example,
setting this value to three (3) requires that any password must have characters
from at least three different categories in order to be approved. The default
value is zero (0), meaning there are no required classes. There are four
categories available:
<pre>
* Upper-case characters
* Lower-case characters
* Digits
* Special characters (for example, punctuation)
</pre>
Modify the <tt>minclass</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> entry
to require <tt>$var_password_pam_minclass</tt>
differing categories of characters when changing passwords.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts
at guessing and brute-force attacks.
<br /><br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The
more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before
the password is compromised.
<br /><br />
Requiring a minimum number of character categories makes password guessing attacks more difficult
by ensuring a larger search space.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_minlen" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Length</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_minlen</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>minlen</tt> parameter controls requirements for
minimum characters required in a password. Add <tt>minlen=<tt>$var_password_pam_minlen</tt></tt>
after pam_pwquality to set minimum password length requirements.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations
that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
<br />
Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength
and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password
helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to
compromise the password.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_ocredit" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Special Characters</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_ocredit</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>ocredit=</tt> parameter controls requirements for
usage of special (or "other") characters in a password. When set to a negative number,
any password will be required to contain that many special characters.
When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1
additional length credit for each special character. Modify the <tt>ocredit</tt> setting
in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to equal <tt>$var_password_pam_ocredit</tt>
to require use of a special character in passwords.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
attacks.
<br /><br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
Requiring a minimum number of special characters makes password guessing attacks
more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_pwquality_password_auth" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM password complexity module is enabled in password-auth</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_pwquality_password_auth</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To enable PAM password complexity in password-auth file:
Edit the <tt>password</tt> section in
<tt>/etc/pam.d/password-auth</tt> to show
<tt>password    requisite                                    pam_pwquality.so</tt>.

The <tt>pam_pwquality</tt> module should be enabled using the <tt>authselect</tt> tool.
By default, <tt>authselect</tt> always configures <tt>pam_pwquality local_users_only</tt> as a part of <tt>local</tt>, <tt>sssd</tt>, and <tt>winbind</tt> profiles.
No additional authselect feature is needed to be enabled.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Enabling PAM password complexity permits to enforce strong passwords and consequently
makes the system less prone to dictionary attacks.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_pwquality_system_auth" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM password complexity module is enabled in system-auth</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_pwquality_system_auth</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To enable PAM password complexity in system-auth file:
Edit the <tt>password</tt> section in
<tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt> to show
<tt>password    requisite                                    pam_pwquality.so</tt>.

The <tt>pam_pwquality</tt> module should be enabled using the <tt>authselect</tt> tool.
By default, <tt>authselect</tt> always configures <tt>pam_pwquality local_users_only</tt> as a part of <tt>local</tt>, <tt>sssd</tt>, and <tt>winbind</tt> profiles.

makes the system less prone to dictionary attacks.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_retry" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Authentication Retry Prompts Permitted Per-Session</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_retry</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To configure the number of retry prompts that are permitted per-session:

Edit the <tt>pam_pwquality.so</tt> statement in

<tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt> to show


<tt>retry=<tt>$var_password_pam_retry</tt></tt>, or a lower value if site
policy is more restrictive. The profile requirement is a maximum of <tt>retry=<tt>$var_password_pam_retry</tt></tt> prompts
per session.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Setting the password retry prompts that are permitted on a per-session basis to a low value
requires some software, such as SSH, to re-connect. This can slow down and
draw additional attention to some types of password-guessing attacks. Note that this
is different from account lockout, which is provided by the pam_faillock module.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_ucredit" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Uppercase Characters</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_ucredit</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The pam_pwquality module's <tt>ucredit=</tt> parameter controls requirements for
usage of uppercase letters in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to
contain that many uppercase characters. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional
length credit for each uppercase character. Modify the <tt>ucredit</tt> setting in
<tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to require the use of an uppercase character in passwords.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts
at guessing and brute-force attacks.
<br /><br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more
complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before
the password is compromised.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_password_pam_unix_remember" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Limit Password Reuse</h3>
<div>accounts_password_pam_unix_remember</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Do not allow users to reuse recent passwords. This can be accomplished by using the
<tt>remember</tt> option for the <tt>pam_unix</tt> or <tt>pam_pwhistory</tt> PAM modules.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Preventing reuse of previous passwords helps ensure that a compromised password is not
reused by a user.</p>
</div>

<div id="accounts_umask_etc_bashrc" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure the Default Bash Umask is Set Correctly</h3>
<div>accounts_umask_etc_bashrc</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To ensure the default umask for users of the Bash shell is set properly,
add or correct the <tt>umask</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/bashrc</tt> to read
as follows:
<pre>umask <tt>$var_accounts_user_umask</tt></pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>The umask value influences the permissions assigned to files when they are created.
A misconfigured umask value could result in files with excessive permissions that can be read or
written to by unauthorized users.</p>
</div>

<div id="package_pam_pwquality_installed" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
The <code>libpwquality</code> package can be installed with the following command:
<pre>
$ sudo dnf install libpwquality</pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure
of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and
brute-force attacks. "pwquality" enforces complex password construction
configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the system.</p>
