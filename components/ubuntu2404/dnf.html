<h2>Rule details</h2>


<div id="clean_components_post_updating" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure apt_get Removes Previous Package Versions</h3>
<div>clean_components_post_updating</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p><tt>apt_get</tt> should be configured to remove previous software components after
new versions have been installed. To configure <tt>apt_get</tt> to remove the

previous software components after updating, set the <tt>::Remove-Unused-Dependencies</tt> and
<tt>::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages</tt>


to <tt>true</tt> in <tt>/etc/apt/apt.conf</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Previous versions of software components that are not removed from the information
system after updates have been installed may be exploited by some adversaries.</p>
</div>

<div id="disable_weak_deps" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable Installation of Weak Dependencies in DNF</h3>
<div>disable_weak_deps</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To disable weak dependencies, set the <tt>install_weak_deps</tt> option to <tt>0</tt> in the <tt>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</tt> file.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Unless a system specifically requires the additional capabilities provides by the weak
dependencies, it is recommended that the packages are not installed to reduce the
potential attack surface.</p>
</div>

<div id="enable_gpgcheck_for_all_repositories" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure gpgcheck Is Enabled for All Package Repositories</h3>
<div>enable_gpgcheck_for_all_repositories</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To ensure signature checking is enabled for all package repositories, the
<tt>gpgcheck</tt> option must be enabled for all repos.
Configure the operating system to verify the signature of packages from
a repository prior to install by setting the following option in
the <tt>"/etc/yum.repos.d/[your_repo_name].repo"</tt> file:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by
a trusted vendor.</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_gpgcheck_globally_activated" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled In Main apt_get Configuration</h3>
<div>ensure_gpgcheck_globally_activated</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option controls whether
RPM packages' signatures are always checked prior to installation.
To configure apt_get to check package signatures before installing
them, ensure the following line appears in <tt>/etc/apt/apt.conf</tt> in
the <tt>[main]</tt> section:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a
trusted vendor.
<br />
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system
components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the
organization.
<br />Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation
validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor.
This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been
provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by
this requirement. Certificates used to verify the software must be from an
approved Certificate Authority (CA).</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_gpgcheck_local_packages" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled for Local Packages</h3>
<div>ensure_gpgcheck_local_packages</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p><tt>apt_get</tt> should be configured to verify the signature(s) of local packages
prior to installation. To configure <tt>apt_get</tt> to verify signatures of local
packages, set the <tt>localpkg_gpgcheck</tt> to <tt>1</tt> in <tt>/etc/apt/apt.conf</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Changes to any software components can have significant effects to the overall security
of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered and
has been provided by a trusted vendor.
<br /><br />
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must
be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.</p>
</div>

<div id="ensure_gpgcheck_repo_metadata" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled for Repository Metadata</h3>
<div>ensure_gpgcheck_repo_metadata</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Verify the operating system prevents the installation of patches,
service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of
local packages without verification of the repository metadata.
Check that <tt>apt_get</tt> verifies the repository
metadata prior to install with the following command.
This should be configured by setting <tt>repo_gpgcheck</tt> to <tt>1</tt>
in <tt>/etc/apt/apt.conf</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Changes to any software components can have significant effects to the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
software has not been tampered and has been provided by a trusted vendor.
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system
components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by
the organization. Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to
installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from
a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it
has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are
disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have
to verify the software again. NOTE: For U.S. Military systems, this
requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however,
the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved
Certificate Authority.</p>
