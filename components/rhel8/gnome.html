<h2>Rule details</h2>


<div id="banner_etc_gdm_banner" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Modify the System GUI Login Banner</h3>
<div>banner_etc_gdm_banner</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To configure the GUI system login banner edit <tt>/etc/gdm/banner</tt>.
Replace the default text with a message compliant with the local site
policy or a legal disclaimer.

The DoD required text is either:
<br /><br />
<tt>You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that
is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes
any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:
<br />-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS
for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC
monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law
enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
<br />-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
<br />-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private,
are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be
disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.
<br />-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access
controls) to protect USG interests -- not for your personal benefit or
privacy.
<br />-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent
to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of
privileged communications, or work product, related to personal
representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and
their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and
confidential. See User Agreement for details.</tt>
<br /><br />
OR:
<br /><br />
<tt>I've read &amp; consent to terms in IS user agreem't.</tt></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting
access to the operating system ensures privacy and security notification
verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
<br /><br />
System use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces
with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not
exist.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_db_up_to_date" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Make sure that the dconf databases are up-to-date with regards to respective keyfiles</h3>
<div>dconf_db_up_to_date</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>By default, DConf uses a binary database as a data backend.
The system-level database is compiled from keyfiles in the /etc/dconf/db/
directory by the <pre>dconf update</pre> command. More specifically, content present
in the following directories:
<pre>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d</pre>
<pre>/etc/dconf/db/local.d</pre></p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Unlike text-based keyfiles, the binary database is impossible to check by OVAL.
Therefore, in order to evaluate dconf configuration, both have to be true at the same time -
configuration files have to be compliant, and the database needs to be more recent than those keyfiles,
which gives confidence that it reflects them.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_banner_enabled" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Enable GNOME3 Login Warning Banner</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_banner_enabled</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In the default graphical environment, displaying a login warning banner
in the GNOME Display Manager's login screen can be enabled on the login
screen by setting <tt>banner-message-enable</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.
<br /><br />
To enable, add or edit <tt>banner-message-enable</tt> to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
banner-message-enable=true</pre>
Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/banner-message-enable</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.
The banner text must also be set.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the operating system
ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
<br /><br />
For U.S. Government systems, system use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces
with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_automount" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable GNOME3 Automounting</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_automount</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The system's default desktop environment, GNOME3, will mount
devices and removable media (such as DVDs, CDs and USB flash drives) whenever
they are inserted into the system. To disable automount within GNOME3, add or set
<tt>automount</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>.
For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/desktop/media-handling]
automount=false</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Disabling automatic mounting in GNOME3 can prevent
the introduction of malware via removable media.
It will, however, also prevent desktop users from legitimate use
of removable media.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_automount_open" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable GNOME3 Automount Opening</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_automount_open</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The system's default desktop environment, GNOME3, will mount
devices and removable media (such as DVDs, CDs and USB flash drives) whenever
they are inserted into the system. To disable automount-open within GNOME3, add or set
<tt>automount-open</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>.
For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/desktop/media-handling]
automount-open=false</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount-open</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Automatically mounting file systems permits easy introduction of unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity.
Disabling automatic mounting in GNOME3 can prevent
the introduction of malware via removable media.
It will, however, also prevent desktop users from legitimate use
of removable media.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_autorun" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable GNOME3 Automount running</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_autorun</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The system's default desktop environment, GNOME3, will mount
devices and removable media (such as DVDs, CDs and USB flash drives) whenever
they are inserted into the system. To disable autorun-never within GNOME3, add or set
<tt>autorun-never</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>.
For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/desktop/media-handling]
autorun-never=true</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/autorun-never</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Automatically mounting file systems permits easy introduction of unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity.
Disabling automatic mount running in GNOME3 can prevent
the introduction of malware via removable media.
It will, however, also prevent desktop users from legitimate use
of removable media.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_ctrlaltdel_reboot" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable Ctrl-Alt-Del Reboot Key Sequence in GNOME3</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_ctrlaltdel_reboot</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> will reboot the system if the
<tt>Ctrl-Alt-Del</tt> key sequence is pressed.
<br /><br />
To configure the system to ignore the <tt>Ctrl-Alt-Del</tt> key sequence
from the Graphical User Interface (GUI) instead of rebooting the system,
add or set <tt>logout</tt> to <tt>['']</tt> in
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys]
logout=['']</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent
user modification. For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/logout</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>A locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, when at the console,
can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in
the case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term
loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_geolocation" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable Geolocation in GNOME3</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_geolocation</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p><tt>GNOME</tt> allows the clock and applications to track and access
location information. This setting should be disabled as applications
should not track system location. To configure the system to disable
location tracking, add or set <tt>enabled</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/system/location]
enabled=false</pre>
To configure the clock to disable location tracking, add or set
<tt>geolocation</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/clocks]
geolocation=false</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent
user modification. For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/system/location/enabled
/org/gnome/clocks/geolocation</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Power settings should not be enabled on systems that are not mobile devices.
Enabling power settings on non-mobile devices could have unintended processing
consequences on standard systems.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_power_settings" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable Power Settings in GNOME3</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_power_settings</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> enables a power profile designed for mobile devices
with battery usage. While useful for mobile devices, this setting should be disabled
for all other systems. To configure the system to disable the power setting, add or set
<tt>active</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power]
active=false
</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Power settings should not be enabled on systems that are not mobile devices.
Enabling power settings on non-mobile devices could have unintended processing
consequences on standard systems.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_restart_shutdown" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable the GNOME3 Login Restart and Shutdown Buttons</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_restart_shutdown</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In the default graphical environment, users logging directly into the
system are greeted with a login screen that allows any user, known or
unknown, the ability the ability to shutdown or restart the system. This
functionality should be disabled by setting
<tt>disable-restart-buttons</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.
<br /><br />
To disable, add or edit <tt>disable-restart-buttons</tt> to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
disable-restart-buttons=true</pre>
Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent
user modification. For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/disable-restart-buttons</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>A user who is at the console can reboot the system at the login screen. If restart or shutdown buttons
are pressed at the login screen, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems
due to reboot.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_thumbnailers" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable All GNOME3 Thumbnailers</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_thumbnailers</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The system's default desktop environment, GNOME3, uses
a number of different thumbnailer programs to generate thumbnails
for any new or modified content in an opened folder. To disable the
execution of these thumbnail applications, add or set <tt>disable-all</tt>
to <tt>true</tt> in <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>.
For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/desktop/thumbnailers]
disable-all=true</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/desktop/thumbnailers/disable-all</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.
This effectively prevents an attacker from gaining access to a
system through a flaw in GNOME3's Nautilus thumbnail creators.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>An attacker with knowledge of a flaw in a GNOME3 thumbnailer application could craft a malicious
file to exploit this flaw. Assuming the attacker could place the malicious file on the local filesystem
(via a web upload for example) and assuming a user browses the same location using Nautilus, the
malicious file would exploit the thumbnailer with the potential for malicious code execution. It
is best to disable these thumbnailer applications unless they are explicitly required.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_user_admin" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable User Administration in GNOME3</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_user_admin</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> will allow all users to have some administratrion
capability. This should be disabled so that non-administrative users are not making
configuration changes. To configure the system to disable user administration
capability in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), add or set
<tt>user-administration-disabled</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/desktop/lockdown]
user-administration-disabled=true
</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/user-administration-disabled</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Allowing all users to have some administratrive capabilities to the system through
the Graphical User Interface (GUI) when they would not have them otherwise could allow
unintended configuration changes as well as a nefarious user the capability to make system
changes such as adding new accounts, etc.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_user_list" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable the GNOME3 Login User List</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_user_list</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In the default graphical environment, users logging directly into the
system are greeted with a login screen that displays all known users.
This functionality should be disabled by setting <tt>disable-user-list</tt>
to <tt>true</tt>.
<br /><br />
To disable, add or edit <tt>disable-user-list</tt> to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
disable-user-list=true</pre>
Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent
user modification. For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/disable-user-list</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Leaving the user list enabled is a security risk since it allows anyone
with physical access to the system to quickly enumerate known user accounts
without logging in.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_wifi_create" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable WIFI Network Connection Creation in GNOME3</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_wifi_create</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p><tt>GNOME</tt> allows users to create ad-hoc wireless connections through the
<tt>NetworkManager</tt> applet. Wireless connections should be disabled by
adding or setting <tt>disable-wifi-create</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/nm-applet]
disable-wifi-create=true
</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/nm-applet/disable-wifi-create</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Wireless network connections should not be allowed to be configured by general
users on a given system as it could open the system to backdoor attacks.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_disable_wifi_notification" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Disable WIFI Network Notification in GNOME3</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_disable_wifi_notification</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> disables WIFI notification. This should be permanently set
so that users do not connect to a wireless network when the system finds one.
While useful for mobile devices, this setting should be disabled for all other systems.
To configure the system to disable the WIFI notification, add or set
<tt>suppress-wireless-networks-available</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/nm-applet]
suppress-wireless-networks-available=true
</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/nm-applet/suppress-wireless-networks-available</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Wireless network connections should not be allowed to be configured by general
users on a given system as it could open the system to backdoor attacks.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_enable_smartcard_auth" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Enable the GNOME3 Login Smartcard Authentication</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_enable_smartcard_auth</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In the default graphical environment, smart card authentication
can be enabled on the login screen by setting <tt>enable-smartcard-authentication</tt>
to <tt>true</tt>.
<br /><br />
To enable, add or edit <tt>enable-smartcard-authentication</tt> to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
enable-smartcard-authentication=true</pre>
Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/enable-smartcard-authentication</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than
that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage PKI
(public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.</p>
</div>

<div id="dconf_gnome_lock_screen_on_smartcard_removal" class="rule" style="border-bottom: 2px solid; margin-bottom: 1cm; padding-bottom: 1cm;">
<h3>Enable the GNOME3 Screen Locking On Smartcard Removal</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_lock_screen_on_smartcard_removal</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In the default graphical environment, screen locking on smartcard removal
can be enabled by setting <tt>removal-action</tt>
to <tt>'lock-screen'</tt>.
<br /><br />

<h3>Set the GNOME3 Login Warning Banner Text</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_login_banner_text</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In the default graphical environment, configuring the login warning banner text
in the GNOME Display Manager's login screen can be configured on the login
screen by setting <tt>banner-message-text</tt> to <tt>'<i>APPROVED_BANNER</i>'</tt>
where <i>APPROVED_BANNER</i> is the approved banner for your environment.
<br /><br />
To enable, add or edit <tt>banner-message-text</tt> to

<pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
banner-message-text='<i>APPROVED_BANNER</i>'</pre>
Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/banner-message-text</pre>

After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.
When entering a warning banner that spans several lines, remember
to begin and end the string with <tt>'</tt> and use <tt>\n</tt> for new lines.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>An appropriate warning message reinforces policy awareness during the logon
process and facilitates possible legal action against attackers.</p>

screen and be configured to restart the authentication process after
a configured number of attempts. This can be configured by setting
<tt>allowed-failures</tt> to <tt>3</tt> or less.
<br /><br />
To enable, add or edit <tt>allowed-failures</tt> to
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]

After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Setting the password retry prompts that are permitted on a per-session basis to a low value
requires some software, such as SSH, to re-connect. This can slow down and
draw additional attention to some types of password-guessing attacks.</p>

<h3>Require Credential Prompting for Remote Access in GNOME3</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_remote_access_credential_prompt</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> does not require credentials when using <tt>Vino</tt> for
remote access. To configure the system to require remote credentials, add or set
<tt>authentication-methods</tt> to <tt>['vnc']</tt> in

<p>By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> requires encryption when using <tt>Vino</tt> for remote access.
To prevent remote access encryption from being disabled, add or set
<tt>require-encryption</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in

<h3>Enable GNOME3 Screensaver Idle Activation</h3>
<div>dconf_gnome_screensaver_idle_activation_enabled</div>

<p>To activate the screensaver in the GNOME3 desktop after a period of inactivity,
add or set <tt>idle-activation-enabled</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in
<tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/idle-activation-enabled</pre>
After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate
physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the absence.
Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity,
GNOME desktops can be configured to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the
session lock.
<br /><br />
Enabling idle activation of the screensaver ensures the screensaver will
be activated after the idle delay.  Applications requiring continuous,
real-time screen display (such as network management products) require the
login session does not have administrator rights and the display station is located in a
controlled-access area.</p>

<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>XDMCP provides unencrypted remote access through the Gnome Display Manager (GDM) which does
not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the
remote session. If a privileged user were to login using XDMCP, the
privileged user password could be compromised due to typed XEvents

<div>gui_login_dod_acknowledgement</div>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the SUSE operating system ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.<br/><br/>

The banner must be acknowledged by the user prior to allowing the user access to the SUSE operating system. This provides assurance that the user has seen the message and accepted the conditions for access. If the consent banner is not acknowledged by the user, DoD will not be in compliance with system use notifications required by law.<br/><br/>

System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.<br/><br/>

The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DoD policy. Use the following verbiage for the SUSE operating system:

<pre>You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.</pre>

Check the configuration by running the following command:
